# Factory Design Pattern Example üçï

This repository contains a Java implementation of the Factory Design Pattern, demonstrating how to create objects without specifying the exact class of the object that will be created. The example includes different types of pizzas (New York style and Italian style) and their respective pizza stores. This project follows the principles outlined in "Head First Design Patterns" to showcase a practical application of the Factory Method.
